Welcome to the Arena of Gaming!

Games are always incredibly fun as they take us to new dimensions partially away from reality, thus refreshing and relaxing our mind. Here I present a simple Gaming Website which offers the users three games namely - Guess My Number, Tic Tac Toe and Color Picker.

Technologies used include - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Firebase to set up the sign in, sign up and authentication functionality.

The first game is - Guess My Number
In this game, a random number would be generated between 1 and 20 and you need to guess the correct number with the given hints in minimum attempts. Lesser the attempts, greater would be your score. Well, it might sound that the game is totally based on luck? But no, implementation of the Binary Search Technique would always land you with a great score. Well, do not ponder and try to guess the number ðŸ™‚

Then we have the famous game which would refresh your childhood memories - Tic Tac Toe
There are two modes in the game - Single Player which allows you to play with the AI and the Multi Player mode in which you can play with your friend.
